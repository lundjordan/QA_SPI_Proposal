QA_SPI_Proposal
===============

A quality assurance assignment focusing on a software process improvement methodology.


Mary, please see a description of what file types I wrote this project in and how to render them.

## what are these source files?
The source files within this root directory are Markdown files. Rather then using Markup for a web page,
I wanted to gain some experience with Markdown and more of how to use Github to its full
potential. 

## How can I render these in a browser?
*there are two ways to view these files*

1. Solution 1: via Github
1. Solution 2: via a gollum server (I think gollum uses sinatra)

### Solution 1
Github can render and host markdown for you inside Wikis. Simply open the link to my 
[repo here](https://github.com/lundjordan/QA_SPI_Proposal) and then click on the 
[wiki tab](https://github.com/lundjordan/QA_SPI_Proposal/wiki). From here you will be presented with my Home page and
a menu for all my documented content. You do not need to be a member nor have to obtain visibility access; it's all
public

### Solution 2
These files can be viewed in a browser via localhost if you have the gollum server installed:

    [sudo] gem install gollum
    
[Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum) has a number of markdown enhancements such as sidebars, footers, 
and in browser editors. You of course do not need Gollum and can simply view all the content via Github.
